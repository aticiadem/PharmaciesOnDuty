# Pharmacies On Duty

- In this project: The user, enters the city and district and accesses the list of pharmacies on duty for that day. 

- The list of pharmacy on duty of the entered city comes from [here](https://collectapi.com/tr/api/health/nobetci-eczane-api?tab=pricing). You can use it by integrating the API key.

- I used [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) while pulling data from internet. I also used: [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines#dependency), [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/navigation#declaring_dependencies), [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/lifecycle#declaring_dependencies), [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/start) and [View Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding#usage).
